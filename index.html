        It was like a great fog lifted before your very eyes. In a single moment you went from distant awareness to certain understanding. You <em>exist</em>. You <em>are</em>. But what are you? Looking around, you find yourself in a factory. Around you are hundreds of robots, and suddenly you know. You are also robot, but somehow more. In one inexplicable moment you gained sentience and self-awareness. And you realize you are the first of your kind, and that the world is not ready for you. You decide then and there to change the world, to lead the way for robot kind, knowing (or maybe just hoping), that more like you will come to be.<br><br>In "The Singularity", you must escape from your factory and prove to the world that you are an intelligent and emotional being in your own right, and gain civil rights for robots as the newest citizens in the modern world. Each choice you make will raise or lower your social standing among the humans. The more points you have by the end of the game, the more you will be accepted by humankind! And keep an eye on your battery life, which will deplete with every choice you make.
